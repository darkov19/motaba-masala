## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Execute the five unchecked `Review Follow-ups (AI)` in `docs/stories/1-7-client-resilience-recovery.md:42`.
2. Should Improve: Keep Story 1.7 in `review` until both High-severity follow-ups are complete.
3. Consider: Add evidence artifacts for manual verification steps in future stories.
