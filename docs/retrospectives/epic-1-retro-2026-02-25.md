# Epic 1 Retrospective - Core Foundation & Infrastructure

Date: 2026-02-25
Facilitator: Bob (Scrum Master)
Project Lead: darko
Epic Reviewed: Epic 1 - Core Foundation & Infrastructure
Next Epic Previewed: Epic 2 - Master Data & Configuration

## Participants
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- darko (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary and Metrics
- Stories completed: 11/11 (100%)
- Sprint tracking status: `epic-1: done`
- Retrospective tracking status before update: `epic-1-retrospective: optional`
- Epic outcome: foundational platform capabilities delivered end-to-end

## Successes and Strengths
- Strong planning quality and epic/story structure guided delivery.
- Core architecture and platform foundations were completed (DB/migrations, licensing, auth/RBAC, backup/recovery, resilience).
- Test maturity improved significantly across the epic.
- Windows validation scripts were useful where present.

## Challenges and Growth Areas
- Execution quality was uneven across stories.
- First-pass completeness was inconsistent and often required follow-up review cycles.
- WSL2 development + Windows runtime context switching introduced repeated integration friction.
- Some evidence and integration checks were added after review feedback instead of before review.

## Story-Level Pattern Synthesis
### Common Struggles
- Multi-round review churn on complex stories (notably 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 1.9).
- Cross-platform behavior gaps surfaced late.
- Security and operational hardening repeatedly required incremental follow-up.

### Recurring Review Feedback
- Implementation often functionally complete but operationally incomplete in first pass.
- Testing proof improved when acceptance criteria were mapped to direct evidence and targeted tests.

### Breakthroughs
- Story 1.2 established durable startup/migration/WAL patterns.
- Story 1.8 established robust recovery-mode and integrity-check patterns.
- Story 1.11 consolidated resilience confidence with integration verification and manual protocols.

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through
- Not applicable: this is Epic 1 and the first retrospective.

## Next Epic (Epic 2) Preview and Dependencies
Epic 2 exists and is ready in scope: Master Data & Configuration (Stories 2.1-2.4).

Dependencies from Epic 1 used by Epic 2:
- Stable DB and migration baseline
- Auth/RBAC and protected API patterns
- Recovery/integrity and backup controls

Primary risk is process consistency, not missing platform capability.

## Significant Discoveries
No major discovery requiring Epic 2 scope rewrite. Changes required are process and quality gate updates.

## Action Items (with Owners and Timelines)
1. Enforce updated Definition of Done (completeness, quality, cross-environment proof).
   - Owner: Bob + Charlie
   - Timeline: before Epic 2 kickoff
   - Success criteria: DoD checklist is present and enforced in every Epic 2 story.

2. Require a Windows validation script for every story (`scripts/sX-Y-win-test.ps1`, modeled after `scripts/s1-11-win-test.ps1`).
   - Owner: Charlie
   - Timeline: first implementation commit of each Epic 2 story
   - Success criteria: each story includes script that builds, runs, and prints pass/fail summary.

3. Update story template/checklist to require Windows validation evidence before review.
   - Owner: Bob + Dana
   - Timeline: prep sprint end
   - Success criteria: no story moves to review without evidence section completed.

4. Create a QA quick-check rubric for WSL2 -> Windows validation.
   - Owner: Dana
   - Timeline: prep sprint end
   - Success criteria: rubric used in every Epic 2 review.

5. Introduce reusable PowerShell helper conventions for per-story scripts.
   - Owner: Charlie
   - Timeline: early Epic 2
   - Success criteria: reduced script duplication and consistent behavior.

## Preparation Tasks for Epic 2
- [ ] Publish DoD update
- [ ] Update story template/checklist with mandatory Windows evidence
- [ ] Finalize script naming/behavior standard
- [ ] Finalize QA validation rubric
- [ ] Draft reusable PowerShell helper conventions

Estimated effort:
- Total preparation: ~2 days
- Critical-path preparation: ~1.5 days

## Critical Path Items
1. Publish updated DoD.
2. Update story template/checklist with mandatory Windows validation evidence.
3. Begin Epic 2 only after items 1 and 2 are complete.

## Readiness Assessment (Epic 1 Closure Check)
Input confirmed by project lead on 2026-02-25:
- Testing complete: Yes
- Deployment status: Pending
- Business/stakeholder validation: Pending
- Technical health: Stable and maintainable
- Unresolved blockers: None

Interpretation:
- Epic 1 is complete from story/engineering perspective.
- Two completion items remain before full business closure: deployment and stakeholder acceptance.

## Commitments and Next Steps
1. Execute prep sprint (~2 days).
2. Complete critical-path process gates before starting Epic 2 implementation.
3. Track deployment and stakeholder acceptance for Epic 1 to final closure.
4. Review action-item progress in next standup.

## Final Team Reflection
- Planning quality was strong.
- Execution quality needs stricter first-pass completeness.
- Cross-environment validation must be standardized per story.
- Team confidence for Epic 2 is good with prep gates in place.
