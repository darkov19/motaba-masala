# Epic 2 Retrospective - Master Data & Configuration

Date: 2026-02-27
Facilitator: Bob (Scrum Master)
Project Lead: darko
Epic Reviewed: Epic 2 - Master Data & Configuration
Next Epic Previewed: Epic 3 - Procurement & Inventory (Inbound)

## Participants
- Bob (Scrum Master)
- Alice (Product Owner)
- Charlie (Senior Dev)
- Dana (QA Engineer)
- Elena (Junior Dev)
- darko (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary and Metrics
- Stories completed: 9/9 (100%)
- Sprint tracking status before update: `epic-2-retrospective: optional`
- Epic outcome: core master data, shell/auth hardening, and RBAC-aligned workflows delivered

## Successes and Strengths
- Core Epic 2 capabilities delivered end-to-end (items, unit conversion, recipes, supplier/customer masters, auth/shell hardening).
- Strong remediation culture: blocked/high-severity review findings were addressed with concrete fixes and regression coverage.
- Good cross-role collaboration between dev/review/QA to close critical findings quickly.

## Challenges and Growth Areas
- First-pass frontend quality did not consistently meet the expected modern UI/UX bar.
- Multiple stories required post-review hardening cycles before truly complete.
- UX conformance to `docs/ux-design-specification.md` was not enforced as a hard gate.

## Story-Level Pattern Synthesis
### Common Struggles
- Review-cycle rework around API contract completeness and authorization edge cases.
- Inconsistent first-pass completeness across frontend-heavy stories.
- Process focus skewed toward implementation closure over UX conformance quality.

### Recurring Review Feedback
- Backend-authoritative auth/RBAC boundaries needed repeated reinforcement.
- API success/error/forbidden contract matrices were initially incomplete in some stories.
- Task completion claims occasionally got ahead of evidence completeness.

### Breakthroughs
- Contract-first approach from Story 2.2A improved downstream coherence.
- Shell/auth corrective stories stabilized the application baseline.
- Team responsiveness to high-severity review findings improved quality trajectory.

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through (Epic 1 -> Epic 2)
Epic 1 action-item continuity review:
- Completed: 1
- In Progress: 2
- Not Addressed: 2

### Follow-through Highlights
- ✅ Per-story Windows validation scripts were adopted consistently.
- ⏳ DoD enforcement improved but is not consistently strong at first pass.
- ❌ Mandatory evidence-before-review gate was not consistently enforced.
- ❌ No explicit QA quick-check rubric artifact was found in story records.

## Next Epic (Epic 3) Preview and Dependencies
Epic 3 exists in `docs/epics.md` with 4 stories:
- 3.1 Goods Received Note (GRN)
- 3.2 Lot Tracking
- 3.3 Third-Party Bulk Procurement
- 3.4 Stock Reconciliation & Audit

Dependencies on Epic 2:
- Item master type integrity (`RAW`, `BULK_POWDER`, `PACKING_MATERIAL`)
- Supplier/customer master readiness
- Conversion correctness for quantity/cost handling
- Backend-authoritative auth/RBAC flow

## Significant Discoveries
### Discovery: UX quality governance gap
The team and project lead agreed that frontend output quality is below expected modern standards and insufficiently aligned to `docs/ux-design-specification.md`.

Impact:
- Risk of carrying UX debt into Epic 3 procurement flows.
- Increased rework and lower stakeholder confidence in frontend polish.

Recommendation:
- Update Epic 3 execution approach with explicit UX conformance gates and role-variant acceptance criteria.

Epic update required:
- Scope rewrite: No
- Execution-plan and quality-gate update: Yes

## Action Items (with Owners and Timelines)
### Process Improvements
1. Add UI/UX Conformance Gate to Definition of Done for all frontend-impact stories.
   - Owner: Bob + Charlie
   - Timeline: before first Epic 3 story starts
   - Success criteria: no story moves to review without UX checklist mapped to `docs/ux-design-specification.md`

2. Add role-variant acceptance criteria in each relevant story (Admin Command Center vs Operator Speed Hub).
   - Owner: Alice
   - Timeline: Epic 3 story drafting phase
   - Success criteria: every Epic 3 UI story has explicit role-specific behavior/layout expectations

3. Add frontend quality review pass before SM review.
   - Owner: Charlie + Dana
   - Timeline: starting Story 3.1
   - Success criteria: pre-review UX pass attached in story notes

### UI/UX Technical Debt
4. Shell/module visual consistency cleanup (tokens, spacing, card treatment, typography scale).
   - Owner: Charlie
   - Priority: High
   - Effort: 8-12h

5. Operator flow friction reduction (keyboard rhythm, focus order, submit/reset speed, quick actions).
   - Owner: Elena + Dana
   - Priority: High
   - Effort: 6-8h

### Documentation
6. Create UX conformance checklist derived from `docs/ux-design-specification.md`.
   - Owner: Dana
   - Deadline: 2 business days

7. Add "UX Acceptance Evidence" block to story template.
   - Owner: Bob
   - Deadline: 2 business days

## Preparation Tasks for Epic 3
- [ ] Publish UX conformance checklist (Owner: Dana, Est: 4h)
- [ ] Update story template with mandatory UX evidence section (Owner: Bob, Est: 2h)
- [ ] Build shared frontend token/style baseline for Epic 3 screens (Owner: Charlie, Est: 6h)
- [ ] Create operator rapid-entry interaction checklist (Owner: Elena, Est: 3h)

Estimated effort:
- Total preparation: ~15 hours (~2 days)

## Critical Path Items
1. UX conformance checklist approved and in use before Story 3.1.
   - Owner: darko + Dana
2. Story template updated with mandatory UX evidence section before Story 3.1.
   - Owner: Bob

## Readiness Assessment (Epic 2 Closure Check)
Input confirmed by project lead on 2026-02-27:
- Testing complete: Yes
- Deployment status: Pending (planned after all epics are done)
- Business/stakeholder validation: Yes
- Technical health: Fine for now
- Unresolved blockers: None

Interpretation:
- Epic 2 is complete from story and stakeholder-acceptance perspective.
- Deployment is intentionally deferred by roadmap strategy.
- No blocker prevents moving into Epic 3 once prep critical path items are complete.

## Commitments and Next Steps
1. Execute UX-focused prep sprint (~2 days).
2. Complete critical-path UX governance items before starting Story 3.1.
3. Apply role-variant UX acceptance criteria to Epic 3 frontend-impact stories.
4. Review action-item progress in next standup.

## Final Team Reflection
- Delivery throughput was strong.
- Frontend UX quality consistency is the key improvement target.
- Team alignment is clear: modern UI/UX quality is now a first-class completion criterion.
